                Born on September 27, 1954, in Osogbo, Nigeria, he grew up in a spiritually vibrant home.
                His grandmother helped shape his early Christian walk, teaching him prayer and the importance
                of tithing from childhood.

            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In May 1981, during an eighteen-hour vision, God delivered a mandate to him:
            </p>

            <blockquote data-aos="zoom-in" class="border-l-4 border-indigo-600 pl-4 italic text-slate-700 mb-6">
                “The hour has come to liberate the world from all oppressions of the devil through the
                preaching of the Word of Faith, and I am sending you to undertake this task.”
            </blockquote>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                This inaugurated what we know today as the Living Faith Church Worldwide, formerly called

                The church began in Kaduna but later moved to Lagos in 1989 following God’s instruction.
                Attendance grew rapidly, filling roads and surrounding buildings with worshippers hungry
                for the Word. This led to the construction of the now-famous Faith Tabernacle.

                in the world. It was dedicated on September 18, 1999.
